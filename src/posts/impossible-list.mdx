# Impossible List

I have a lot of interests. Development, Gaming, YouTube, Sports, Design... the list goes on. The problem is that I tend to get analysis paralysis, 'What should I be doing now?' The Impossible List helps steer that drive.

I found The Impossible List during college and always wanted to start one. Like a bucket list, The Impossible List contains a broad list of things I would like to accomplish. The idea is that this list will go beyond the regular bucket list. It does so in a few ways.

- This long-term list drives short-term goals
- Crossing something off of this list drives momentum
- Having this list public holds me accountable
- I just think it is really cool

I was inspired to create this list by [College Info Geek](https://collegeinfogeek.com/about/meet-the-author/my-impossible-list/) and by extension [ImpossibleHQ](https://impossiblehq.com/impossible-list/).
