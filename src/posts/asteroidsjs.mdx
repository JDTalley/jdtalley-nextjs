I have wanted to make a game for a long time.

One of my earliest memories is playing Sonic 2 and having to get my older brother to beat the second boss. I also remember him letting me score a touchdown in Madden after I cried because I was losing (Thanks, bro). I even went to college intending to become a game developer.

That plan has not panned out quite yet. A few years back, however, I wanted a new project to work on while learning JavaScript. Enter AsteroidsJS.

The original Asteroids arcade game is a solid choice for a first game. Simple vector graphics, fairly ubiquitous, and simple controls. I think it would have been easier to use a library like three.js or phaser, but my goal was to learn as much as possible.
