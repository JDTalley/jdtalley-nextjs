Do you ever daydream about all the incredible things you'd love to achieve in your lifetime? Whether it is launching a new business, learning a new skill, or finally getting out to see the places you have always dreamed of, we all have what can seem like lofty aspirations that never become a reality. But what if I told you it doesn't have to be that way?

Enter The Impossible List. The concept redefines how we set and achieve our life goals. Unlike the traditional bucket list, an impossible list is a dynamic, evolving document of your personal growth and ambitions.

But it isn't just about setting unrealistic targets; it's about breaking them down into actionable steps, creating a roadmap to success, and looking back at the journey.

Below is my impossible list. I publish it to hold myself accountable and as a motivator to continue to grow.

I was inspired to create this list by [College Info Geek](https://collegeinfogeek.com/about/meet-the-author/my-impossible-list/) so check them out for more!
